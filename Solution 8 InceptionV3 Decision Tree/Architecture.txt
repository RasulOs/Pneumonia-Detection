************************************ Decision Tree 

For Decision Tree, the weights from 1 neural net (256 neurons) were taken
as input for decision tree. Input size of decision tree is 256 + 1(bias). 

Maximum depth of Decision Tree is 6.

Accuracy (of Decision Tree) on test set: 93.00%

Confusion matrix (For Decision Tree):

	[[156  23]
	[ 18 389]]
